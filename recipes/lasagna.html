        <li> Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic in an oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
        <li> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons
             parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds and pepper. Simmer,covered 
             for about 1 and a half hours, stirring occassionally. </li>
        <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 
             8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. </li>
        <li> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and half a
             teaspoon of salt </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li> To assemble, spread 1 and a half cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. 
             Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with half of the 
             Ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 and a half 
             cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella and sprinkle with a quarter cup of Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li> Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
